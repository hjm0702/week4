# Week 4

Today we continue to examine the notion of refactoring to see how different
refactoring practices affect software design.

We will take the quiz during the last 20 minutes of class.

**Key Idea**

> Refactoring is the internal redesign of working code.

Agenda:

* Feedback on homework #2 and the reading assignments?
* Stubs and Mocks, Revisited
* Design Notation, Part 1
* I will demonstrate the famous _Bowling Game Kata_
* We will use what we learned from the kata to derive a theory by Bob Martin
  known as the _transformation priority premise_.
* We will consider the possibility that step-wise transformations could offer
  a proof of correctness for software design.
* We will look at how a sorting algorithm might be achieved with TPP.
* Finally, we will take quiz #1 at around 8:00pm.
